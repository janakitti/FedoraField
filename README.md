# FedoraField

FedoraField is a 2D top-down action video game where you play as a character with a magical fedora that has the ability to control gravitational and electromagnetic fields. That's it. No guns, swords, or shields. The object of the game is to bring as many Blue Orbs (scattered across the level) to a central Beacon as possible while avoiding Pink Enemies and their bullets. Be careful though, Orbs will shatter if they touch anything (including you!).
